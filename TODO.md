# TODO

- Include more details for each upcoming project
    - Genres
    - Plot synopsis
    - Release year if applicable
    - In production status (filmin, pre-production, etc)
- Include picture of director/actor beside their name in the subheader
- Make a bash script or something that runs the python script e.g. every week on a Raspberry Pi
- Maybe only include movies and TV shows that have not been included in a previous announcement
    - Create a json file or something that is updated with all the new upcoming projects
    - Next time the script is run: Check if the json file already includes upcoming projects that has been found
    - Check if any of the upcoming projects in the json file has been released

- Check some sort of website for news about upcoming projects and add the news articles to a file or something
- Include news articles and make it sort of like a newsletter
