# TODO

- Add support for TV shows
- Include more details for each upcoming project
  - [Keywords](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/movie-keywords)
- [Include picture](https://developers.notion.com/reference/file-object) from TMDb of director/actor beside their name in the Notion database
- [Include picture](https://developers.notion.com/reference/file-object) from TMDb of movie poster in the Notion database
- Make a bash script or something that runs the python script e.g. every week on a Raspberry Pi

## Bugs/Issues/Stuff

- Sometimes several duplicates of the same movie are added to the database
  - Maybe because the same movie is found for different actors/directors? If so, why does it only show the same actor/director for each duplicate?
  - Doesn't have several actors/directors I like for a couple movies I checked, so probably not that
