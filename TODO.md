- Ensure that film projects are only added once if there are multiple selected people involved with the project
- Include more details for each upcoming project
    - Release year if applicable
    - In production status (filmin, pre-production, etc)
- Include picture of director/actor beside their name in the Notion database (https://developers.notion.com/reference/file-object)
- Make a bash script or something that runs the python script e.g. every week on a Raspberry Pi

- Check some sort of website for news about upcoming projects and add the news articles to a file or something
