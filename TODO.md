# TODO

- Check if any of the upcoming projects in the json file has been released
- Ensure that film projects are only added once if there are multiple selected people involved with the project
- Include more details for each upcoming project
  - Release date/year if applicable
  - Popularity score (https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/popularity)
  - Keywords (https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/movie-keywords)
- Include picture of director/actor beside their name in the Notion database (https://developers.notion.com/reference/file-object)
- Make a bash script or something that runs the python script e.g. every week on a Raspberry Pi
