# A little project that checks for upcoming movies and TV shows by certain directors (and actors maybe)

## The list of directors
An online notepad is used so the list of directors I like can be changed at any time from anywhere. The python script will then retrieve this list when it is run.

## IMDb
The script will go through the list of directors and look for their page on IMDb and search for movies and TV shows currently in production. 

## Output of Python code
All upcoming productions are listed in markdown format and written to a file. A preview of the format can be seen in [this file](https://github.com/vkroyer/Scraper/blob/master/OutputPreview.md).
